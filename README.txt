This is my contribution for GAME OFF 2018
The theme was "Hybrid"
My game is a Hybrid of a SOKOBAN like game, and a match three game, one of those
where putting together three things of the same type gives you points and an
upgraded thing.
The "things" here are referred to as "boxes", and since I did the graphics by myself
they are represented by wonderful colored squares.
The top level box has a shape that vaguely reminds that of a companion cube
because, why not? These boxes can be moved, but cannot be matched together
(who wants to lose one of those?).
Another square, with a smiley face on it, is the player.
There are four different game modes:
1. Normal: It starts slowly, more boxes appear every few seconds. Put three
   boxes of the same color close to each other and give them a little push to
   match them, get points and a higher level box. When points grow, the game
   gets faster and boxes appear quickly. The objective of this game mode is to
   get as many points as possible. The game ends when the player cannot move
   anymore.
2. Crazy: just like normal, but faster.
3. Peaceful: The pace of the game does not change during the game. Objective:
   get as many companion boxes as you can.
4. Race: make one companion box as fast as you can.

This is my first game, and my first attempt to write such a big piece of code.
I hope you will enjoy it, I do! In fact, this made it harder in the last days,
when the game was alost complete, I was playing instead of writing code...
